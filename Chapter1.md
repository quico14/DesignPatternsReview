# Chapter 1 notes

## Design principles

* **First design principle**: Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
* **Second design principle**: Program to an interface, not an implementation.
* **Third design principle**: Favor composition over inheritance.

## Strategy Pattern

Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and mix them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
